# LoadTestTools

This solution was created with the goal making it easy to create and manage API load tests.  To accomplish this goal, a package was created with a set of predefined SpecFlow bindings which allow a consumer to easily make API GET requests to any URL.

**_This code should only be used for good and for approved purposes.  Do not load test any API without owner approval._**
